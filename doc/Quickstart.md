## 🎬 Editor Pre-generation

The editor interface allows you to generate audio sentences and download them as a file. The audio files can then be imported to your Project.

1. On the Editor main window, go to **Window** > **ArielVoiceGeneration**:<br/><br/>
![open ariel editor interface](/res/project_settings.png)

2. The Ariel Editor Window should open. Enter the sentence and adjust parameters according to your needs:<br/><br/>
![ariel editor interface](/res/ariel_editor.png)

*  On the ![pink box](https://placehold.co/10x10/ff66b2/ff66b2) <b style="color: #ff66b2">Pink box</b>, enter the API Key provided to you. The API Key is required to generate the audio file. If you do not have an API Key, please contact us at *contact@xandimmersion.com*. If no speakers are available, you need to press on *Fetch Speakers* to get all local and remote speakers.

*   On the ![yellow box](https://placehold.co/10x10/ffff33/ffff33) <b style="color: #ffff33">Yellow box</b>, enter the sentence that will be generated by the API. The sentence supports [tags](/doc/Features.md#-tags), like `<pause 1s>`.

*   On the ![blue box](https://placehold.co/10x10/3398ff/3398ff) <b style="color: #3398ff">Blue box</b>, select the speaker and the language that will be used to generate the sentence. You can use the fields *Language* Dropdown to see which languages exist for the currently selected speaker. By checking the *Local Generation* Checkbox you are switching between the local and the remote TTS generation. The speakers are displayed accordingly. See [speakers list](/README.md#speakers).

*   On the ![orange box](https://placehold.co/10x10/ffb266/ffb266) <b style="color: #ffb266">Orange box</b>, adjust the pitch (in semitones), the audio speed and the volume (in dB) that will be applied to the audio file before saving it. You can also use your favorite game audio software tool to change those settings more dynamically **after** the file was saved.

*   On the ![green box](https://placehold.co/10x10/66ff66/66ff66) <b style="color: #66ff66">Green box</b>, you can add [audio effects](/doc/Features.md#-audio-effects) that will be applied to the audio file. Those audio effects are optional. You can also select Stereo Audio, High Sample Rate (44kHz) and a voice Improvement algorithm which will enhance the generated audio. You can also select if you want to use a previously generated Glossary.

*   On the ![purple box](https://placehold.co/10x10/b266ff/b266ff) <b style="color: #b266ff">Purple box</b>, you can add new voice channels to add another voice generation setting. You can add and remove as many channels as you want. All the channels will be generated.

*   On the ![red box](https://placehold.co/10x10/ff6666/ff6666) <b style="color: #ff6666">Red box</b>, Select the audio file destination and filename. We recommend to always use the *WAV* format, as MP3 is not natively supported with Unreal Engine yet.


## 🎤 Runtime generation

> The runtime version of Ariel in Unity is currently not available. We are working on it and will release it soon. The functionality already exists inside the c# code, but we are working for a Demo Scene to show how to use it. Feel free to use our functions to your own liking that are explained in the [API Reference](/doc/API.md).

<!-- You can find a **<ins>fully operational</ins> Blueprint Actor** that generate and play an audio SoundWave at runtime. The actor is located in the Ariel plugin Content.

0. Open the *Content Drawer* (Ctrl+Space) and click on *Settings* in the upper right corner of the Window. Make sure that *"Show Engine Content"* and *"Show Plugin Content"* are checked.<br/>
![Content drawer settings](/res/content_drawer_settings.png)

1. Depending on if you have installed through the Marketplace or a ZIP archive, go respectively to **All** > **Engine** > **Plugins** > **Ariel Content** <ins>*or*</ins> **All** > **Plugins** > **Ariel Content**.<br/>
![Content drawer explorer](/res/ariel_demo_actor_location.png)

2. Drag and drop the `Ariel_Demo` Blueprint Actor to your level:<br/>
![Drag ariel demo actor](/res/ariel_demo_drag.png)

3. Click on the `⋮` button next to the **Play** button > **Simulate**. Then, select the Ariel demo actor in the level:<br/>
![Select demo actor](/res/select_ariel_demo.png)

4. On the detail Window, go to the *"Ariel"* section and change the Ariel parameters according to your needs. See [Ariel Text-To-Speech](/doc/API.md#ariel-text-to-speech) node for more details about parameters. [Tags](/doc/Features.md#-tags) can be included in the sentence.<br/>
![Demo actor parameters](/res/ariel_demo_editor.png)

5. Click the "Ariel TTS" button. If the player is close to the Ariel demo Actor, you should be able to hear the generated SoundWave.

→ Do not hesitate to look at the Ariel demo Actor Blueprint Event graph to see the nodes used to generate the speech. You can find more information about the nodes on the [API Reference](/doc/API.md), especially the nodes *[Ariel Text-to-Speesh](/doc/API.md#ariel-text-to-speech)*, *[On Ariel Response](/doc/API.md#on-ariel-response)* and *[Audio WAV bytes to SoundWave](/doc/API.md#audio-wav-bytes-to-soundwave)*.


6. We also added an Ariel Demo Interface which will be added to the Viewport when running the Demo Project. You can use this interface to generate speech with the Ariel Demo Actor. The interface is located in the Ariel plugin Content.

There are 3 entriepoints to the Ariel Demo Actor:

- Begin Play: Initialize the Ariel Demo Actor to start the local Ariel Server in the background and triggers an initial speech generation.
- Ariel TTS Local: Call the local Ariel API to generate the speech with the demo Actor parameters. You need to make sure that the Local Ariel Server is running in the background (should automatically run after Begin Play).
- Ariel TTS: Call the online Ariel API to generate the speech with the demo Actor parameters. You need to make sure that the Online Ariel Server is running in the background.

1. ![blue box](https://placehold.co/10x10/3398ff/3398ff) The node *[Remote TTS](/doc/API.md#ariel-text-to-speech)* is used to call the Ariel API and generate the speech with the demo Actor parameters.<br/>
2. ![red box](https://placehold.co/10x10/ff6666/ff6666) The event *[Local TTS](/doc/API.md#on-ariel-response)* is used to call the local Ariel API and generate the speech with the demo Actor parameters.<br/>


![Ariel demo blueprint](/res/ariel_demo_blueprint_finished.png)


3. ![purple box](https://placehold.co/10x10/b266ff/b266ff) The node *[Play Audio](/doc/API.md#audio-wav-bytes-to-soundwave)* is used to generate a SoundWave Asset from the API response bytes data. It also includes the nodes *Set Sound* and *Play* from the Unreal Audio Component that are used to play the generated SoundWave Asset.<br/>
4. ![green box](https://placehold.co/10x10/66ff66/66ff66) This is used to set the Variable InProgress to false when the audio is finished generating. This is used to prevent the actor from generating a new audio while the previous one is still generating.<br/> -->


## 📚 Glossary

The glossary is a list of words that are pronounced differently than they are written. The glossary is used to improve the pronunciation of the generated audio. The glossary is a JSON file that can be generated by the plugin. The glossary is optional and can be used in the editor interface.

Using the Glossary you can Add or Remove words that are not pronounced correctly by the TTS engine. The Glossary is a JSON file that can be generated by the plugin. 

You can save your glossary to a local file and load it in the editor interface.
